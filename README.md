The objective of this project is to create tweet cards with interactive features for the user. When the "Follow" button is clicked, its text changes to "Following" along with a change in button color. Additionally, the number of followers increases by adding the user's count to the current value.
To store user data, a personal backend is implemented using the mockapi.io service. The database contains a total of 12 users with different values, which are displayed in the tweet cards. There is an option to load additional tweets by clicking the "Load More" button, providing pagination functionality.
Furthermore, the project includes routing functionality. The application has two main routes: the home page ("/") and the tweets page ("/tweets"). Additionally, tweet card filtering has been implemented.
The project is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, axios, prop-types, react-router-dom, classnames, mockapi, figma, GitHub, and Vite.js.
